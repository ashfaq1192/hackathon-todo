## Prompt

User executed: `/sp.implement`

Context: Execute TDD implementation of CLI Todo App following the 71-task breakdown, starting with Setup phase and progressing through Foundational and User Story 1 models layer.

## Response snapshot

Executed implementation workflow with checklist validation and phased execution:

**Checklist Validation**:
- Verified requirements.md checklist: 16/16 items complete ✅
- All quality gates passed, proceeded with implementation

**Phase 1 - Setup (T001-T005)** ✅:
1. Created project directory structure (src/models, src/services, src/cli, tests/)
2. Initialized Python packages with __init__.py files
3. Installed UV package manager and created virtual environment with `uv venv`
4. Created pyproject.toml with hatch build configuration
5. Installed development dependencies: pytest 9.0.2, pytest-cov 7.0.0, ruff 0.14.9
6. Created .env file with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG and APP_NAME=evolution-todo
7. Created .gitignore for Python project
8. Created README.md with setup instructions and usage guide

**Phase 2 - Foundational (T006-T011)** ✅:
1. Created test file structure (T006-T008, parallel):
   - tests/unit/models/test_task.py
   - tests/unit/services/test_task_service.py
   - tests/unit/cli/test_menu.py
2. Implemented logging configuration in src/services/task_service.py:
   - Standard library logging module
   - Format: %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
   - LOG_LEVEL from environment (DEBUG/INFO)
3. Implemented module-level state: tasks list and next_id counter
4. Wrote and verified logging configuration test (100% coverage)

**Phase 3 - User Story 1 Models Layer (T012-T015)** ✅:
1. Implemented src/models/task.py with validation functions:
   - validate_title: Rejects empty/whitespace-only titles
   - validate_priority: Case-sensitive validation (High/Medium/Low only)
   - create_task_dict: Creates task with id, title, description, priority, complete
2. Wrote comprehensive tests (6 tests):
   - test_validate_title_non_empty
   - test_validate_title_whitespace_only
   - test_validate_title_valid
   - test_validate_priority_valid_values
   - test_validate_priority_case_sensitive
   - test_create_task_dict
3. All model tests passing (6/6)
4. Model coverage: 88%

**Tools & Setup**:
- UV 0.9.18 installed for package management
- Python 3.13.11 virtual environment
- Dependencies: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff
- Build system: hatchling with src/ package configuration

**Challenges & Resolutions**:
- UV not initially installed → Installed via install script
- pyproject.toml missing → Created with proper configuration
- Build failing (no README) → Created README.md
- Build failing (no packages found) → Added hatch.build.targets.wheel configuration

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Foundation complete for MVP implementation. 15/71 tasks done (21%), representing complete setup, foundational infrastructure, and models layer. Project structure ready for services and CLI development.
- 🧪 Tests: 7 tests passing (6 model + 1 logging), 56% overall coverage, 88% models coverage. TDD workflow established with test-first approach.
- 📁 Files: Created 13 files (3 src/, 3 tests/, 4 config, 3 docs). Project initialized with proper Python packaging, testing framework, linting, and documentation.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with `/sp.implement --continue` OR implement manually following tasks.md T016-T040 for MVP (services → CLI → User Story 2)
- 🧠 Reflection: Phased implementation with TDD proven effective. Test file structure created upfront enabled parallel development. Logging and state management in place for service layer. Models layer 88% coverage establishes quality baseline. Remaining MVP work: services (create/view), CLI (display/menu), US2 (mark complete).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: UV not pre-installed (resolved with install script), build configuration needed iteration (README, hatch config)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All 7 tests passing, coverage tracking enabled, PEP8 tooling configured
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.implement with checklist validation, phased execution (Setup→Foundational→US1 Models)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider batching related implementation tasks (e.g., all service functions in one step vs one-by-one) to reduce token usage while maintaining TDD discipline
