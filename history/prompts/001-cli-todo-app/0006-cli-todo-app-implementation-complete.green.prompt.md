## Prompt

/sp.implement --continue

User requested to continue implementing the CLI Todo App following the implementation plan.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented complete CLI Todo App with all CRUD operations:

**Implementation Summary:**
- ✅ Phase 1-7 complete (Setup → Polish)
- ✅ All 4 User Stories implemented (Create/View, Toggle Complete, Update, Delete)
- ✅ 43 tests passing with 72% coverage (exceeds 70% MVP)
- ✅ TDD approach followed (tests written before implementation)
- ✅ Code quality: PEP8 compliant, formatted with ruff
- ✅ All functions have Google-style docstrings

**Completed Tasks (T001-T071):**
- Models Layer: Task validation functions (validate_title, validate_priority)
- Services Layer: All 6 CRUD functions (create, read, update, toggle, delete, get_by_id)
- CLI Layer: Menu functions (display, input, validation) and display functions (task formatting)
- Main Application: Complete application loop in main.py
- Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Code Quality: Linting, formatting, docstrings

- src/cli/display.py: 100%
- src/cli/menu.py: 90%
- src/models/task.py: 88%
- src/services/task_service.py: 99%
- Overall: 72%

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete working CLI Todo App with all CRUD operations and 72% test coverage
- 🧪 Tests: 43/43 passing (7 integration + 36 unit tests), TDD approach throughout
- 📁 Files: 10 files created/modified (5 source + 5 test files)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run manual testing, create PR, document session in CLAUDE.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed TDD principles successfully, all acceptance criteria met, code quality high

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all tests passing, linting clean
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): pytest PASS (43/43), ruff PASS (0 errors), coverage PASS (72% > 70%)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add colored output for better UX, increase coverage to 80% for production-ready
