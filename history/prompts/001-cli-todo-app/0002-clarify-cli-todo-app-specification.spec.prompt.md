## Prompt

User executed: `/sp.clarify`

Context: Clarify ambiguities and missing decision points in the CLI Todo App specification before proceeding to implementation planning.

## Response snapshot

Conducted a structured 5-question clarification session addressing critical ambiguities in the spec:

1. **Completion Status Behavior**: Clarified that tasks can toggle between complete and incomplete states (not one-way only)

2. **ID Reuse Policy**: Clarified that task IDs never reuse deleted values - always increment monotonically

3. **Task Display Ordering**: Clarified that tasks are displayed sorted by priority (High > Medium > Low), with incomplete tasks appearing before completed tasks within each priority group, and tasks with same priority/status ordered by ID ascending

4. **Menu Interface Pattern**: Clarified that the menu uses numbered selection (1, 2, 3, etc.) for operations

5. **Update Field Granularity**: Clarified that users can update individual task fields (partial updates) - only provided fields are changed, others remain unchanged

Each clarification was immediately integrated into the spec file with updates to:
- Clarifications section (new Session 2025-12-17 subsection)
- User Stories (acceptance scenarios updated)
- Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-003, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)
- Key Entities (Task entity attributes)
- Edge Cases (10+ new edge case clarifications added)

All updates maintain internal consistency across the spec document.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Resolved 5 critical ambiguities spanning data model, UX interaction, and functional behavior. Spec now has clear, testable requirements ready for planning phase.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (specification refinement only)
- 📁 Files: Modified specs/001-cli-todo-app/spec.md with 5 clarifications + 20+ integration points across user stories, requirements, and edge cases
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` - proceed to architecture and implementation planning with clarified requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Systematic clarification with immediate incremental integration prevented ambiguity accumulation and ensured consistency. Priority-based question selection focused on highest-impact areas (state management, data integrity, UX patterns).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all clarifications successfully integrated without conflicts
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - validation confirmed no contradictions, all placeholders resolved, terminology consistent
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.clarify workflow with immediate incremental integration after each answer
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider auto-detecting if certain categories (e.g., sort order, menu patterns) are underspecified based on keyword absence in spec sections
