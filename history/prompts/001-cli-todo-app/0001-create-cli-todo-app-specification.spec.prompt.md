## Prompt

/sp.specify
Phase I: CLI Todo App with Basic CRUD Operations

Implement a menu-driven CLI todo application with in-memory storage supporting:
- Add Task (title, description)
- View Task List (show all tasks with status)
- Mark Task as Complete
- Update Task (edit title/description)
- Delete Task

Data structure: list of dicts with {id: int, title: str, description: str, complete: bool}
Technology: Python 3.13+, UV, pytest, ruff
Priority: P1 = Add/View/Mark, P2 = Update/Delete, P3 = Enhancements

## Response snapshot

Created feature branch `001-cli-todo-app` and specification document at `specs/001-cli-todo-app/spec.md`.

**Specification Summary**:

**4 User Stories** (prioritized High/Medium):
1. Create and View Tasks (High) - Core functionality for adding and viewing tasks
2. Mark Tasks Complete (High) - Track completion status
3. Update Task Details (Medium) - Edit existing tasks
4. Delete Tasks (Medium) - Remove unwanted tasks

**15 Functional Requirements**: Menu-driven interface, CRUD operations, ID-based task management, input validation, error handling, confirmation messages

**Key Entity**: Task (id, title, description, complete)

**7 Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes including operation timing (15 sec add, 3 sec view), 100% success rate for valid operations, error handling without crashes, session persistence

**Edge Cases Covered**: Empty titles, invalid IDs, whitespace handling, optional descriptions, ID uniqueness

**Specification Quality Checklist**: All items passed
- ✅ No implementation details (technology-agnostic)
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ Ready for planning phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase I specification complete and validated - defines all 5 CRUD operations with clear acceptance criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable at spec stage (acceptance scenarios defined for future testing)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-cli-todo-app/spec.md and checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully avoids technical details while maintaining clarity. Priority breakdown (High for Add/View/Mark, Medium for Update/Delete) aligns with constitution MVP requirements using standardized task category terminology.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Requirements checklist - ALL PASS (14/14 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with constitution-aligned priorities
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan for 001-cli-todo-app
