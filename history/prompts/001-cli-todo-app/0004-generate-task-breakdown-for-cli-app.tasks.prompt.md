## Prompt

User executed: `/sp.tasks`

Context: Generate actionable, dependency-aware task breakdown for CLI Todo App implementation following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, organized by user story.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 71 tasks organized across 7 phases:

**Task Organization by User Story**:

1. **Phase 1 - Setup** (5 tasks):
   - Project structure initialization
   - Virtual environment setup
   - Dependency installation (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff)
   - Environment configuration (.env file)

2. **Phase 2 - Foundational** (6 tasks):
   - Test file structure creation
   - Logging configuration
   - Module-level state management
   - 3 parallel tasks identified

3. **Phase 3 - User Story 1: Create and View Tasks** (19 tasks):
   - Models layer: Task validation (title, priority)
   - Services layer: create_task, get_all_tasks with multi-level sorting
   - CLI layer: display_task, display_task_list, prompt_add_task
   - Integration tests for add and view workflow
   - 4 parallel test-writing opportunities
   - **MVP Critical** - High priority user story

4. **Phase 4 - User Story 2: Mark Complete/Incomplete** (9 tasks):
   - Services layer: toggle_task_completion with bidirectional toggle
   - CLI layer: prompt_task_id
   - Integration tests for toggle workflow
   - 3 parallel test opportunities
   - **MVP Critical** - High priority user story
   - Dependencies: Requires US1 (create_task, get_all_tasks)

5. **Phase 5 - User Story 3: Update Task Details** (9 tasks):
   - Services layer: update_task with partial field updates
   - CLI layer: prompt_update_task
   - Integration tests for update workflow
   - 3 parallel test opportunities
   - **Production-Ready** - Medium priority user story
   - Dependencies: Requires US1 (create_task, get_all_tasks)

6. **Phase 6 - User Story 4: Delete Tasks** (8 tasks):
   - Services layer: delete_task with ID non-reuse verification
   - CLI layer: delete menu flow
   - Integration tests for delete workflow
   - 3 parallel test opportunities
   - **Production-Ready** - Medium priority user story
   - Dependencies: Requires US1 (create_task, get_all_tasks)

7. **Phase 7 - Polish & Cross-Cutting** (14 tasks):
   - Main application loop implementation
   - Menu display and input handling
   - Success/error message display
   - Code quality: PEP8 compliance, docstrings, formatting
   - Documentation: README.md, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore
   - Coverage verification (70% MVP, 80% production-ready)
   - 5 parallel tasks identified

**Key Features**:

- **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation for all components
- **User Story Organization**: Each story is independently testable increment
- **Dependency Graph**: Clear completion order with US1 as foundation
- **Parallelization**: 21 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- **MVP Scope Defined**: Phase 1-4 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2) = 39 tasks
- **Production-Ready Scope**: All 71 tasks including US3 and US4
- **Task Format**: All tasks follow strict checklist format with IDs, labels, file paths
- **Independent Testing**: Each phase has clear acceptance criteria

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ All 71 tasks follow format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [Labels] Description with path`
- ✅ All user story tasks labeled [US1], [US2], [US3], [US4]
- ✅ All parallelizable tasks marked [P]
- ✅ Sequential task IDs (T001-T071)
- ✅ All 4 user stories from spec.md represented
- ✅ All 6 service functions from contracts covered
- ✅ All CLI functions from contracts covered
- ✅ Dependency graph shows US2/US3/US4 can run in parallel after US1

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Sprint 1 (MVP Core): Setup + Foundational + US1 → Can add/view tasks
- Sprint 2 (MVP Complete): US2 + Polish subset → Working CLI with mark complete
- Sprint 3 (Production-Ready): US3 + US4 + Full polish → All CRUD operations

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation roadmap with 71 actionable tasks enabling TDD workflow. Clear MVP path (39 tasks) vs production-ready path (71 tasks). Each user story independently testable with explicit dependencies.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (planning phase). Test strategy embedded: 35 test-writing tasks before 36 implementation tasks (TDD). Coverage targets: 70% MVP, 80% production-ready.
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md (500+ lines) with 7-phase breakdown, dependency graph, parallel execution examples, validation checklist, quick reference commands.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` - execute tasks following TDD workflow, starting with Setup phase
- 🧠 Reflection: User story organization enables incremental delivery (each story is shippable). Dependency analysis shows US2/US3/US4 independent after US1, allowing parallel implementation. TDD structure with tests-first ensures quality gates before implementation. Parallelization opportunities (21 tasks) reduce wall-clock time.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all tasks generated with proper format and dependencies
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Format validation confirms all 71 tasks follow checklist syntax. Completeness validation confirms all user stories, contracts, and entities covered.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user-story-first organization (vs layer-first). Explicit TDD task ordering (test before impl).
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider generating estimated time per task (S/M/L sizing) to help users prioritize and track velocity across sprints
