## Prompt

User executed: `/sp.plan`

Context: Generate comprehensive implementation plan for CLI Todo App with Basic CRUD Operations based on clarified spec.

## Response snapshot

Executed complete planning workflow including:

**Phase 0 - Research**:
- Documented Python 3.13+ choice with stdlib-only approach for MVP
- Researched in-memory storage pattern (list of dicts)
- Established numbered menu interface pattern per clarifications
- Defined multi-level task sorting algorithm (completion → priority → ID)
- Determined ID generation strategy (monotonic increment, no reuse)
- Documented partial update pattern for field updates
- Established TDD testing strategy with pytest (70% MVP, 80% production-ready)
- Defined logging strategy using Python stdlib logging module
- Specified layered architecture (Models → Services → CLI)

**Phase 1 - Data Model & Contracts**:

1. **data-model.md**: Comprehensive task entity definition
   - Task structure: `{id: int, title: str, description: str, priority: str, complete: bool}`
   - Field specifications with validation rules
   - State transition lifecycle
   - Sorting rules: (complete, priority_order, id)
   - System invariants (ID uniqueness, monotonicity, priority values)
   - Phase II migration considerations

2. **contracts/service_contract.md**: Service layer API specification
   - 6 core functions: create_task, get_all_tasks, get_task_by_id, update_task, toggle_task_completion, delete_task
   - Tuple return format: `(success: bool, message: str, data: Optional[dict|list])`
   - Detailed validation rules and error responses
   - Side effects documentation (state changes, logging)
   - Usage examples and testing requirements

3. **contracts/cli_contract.md**: CLI layer API specification
   - menu.py: display_main_menu, get_menu_choice, prompt_add_task, prompt_task_id, prompt_update_task
   - display.py: display_task, display_task_list, display_success_message, display_error_message
   - Input validation patterns (loops until valid)
   - Output formatting specifications
   - User interaction flow examples

4. **quickstart.md**: Developer onboarding guide
   - 5-minute setup instructions
   - TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)
   - Implementation order: Models → Services → CLI → Main
   - Testing commands and coverage checks
   - Code quality checks (ruff)
   - Definition of Done checklists (MVP + Production-Ready)

**Technical Context** (plan.md):
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Dependencies: pytest, ruff (no runtime dependencies)
- Storage: In-memory list
- Performance: <15s add, <3s view
- Project structure: Single CLI application

**Constitution Check** (Initial + Post-Design):
- ✅ All gates passed
- ⚠️ Reusable Intelligence deferred to Phase III (appropriate)
- ✅ Architecture supports future bonus features
- ✅ Development standards fully defined

**Agent Context Update**:
- Added Python 3.13+ with stdlib to CLAUDE.md
- Added in-memory storage specification
- Preserved manual additions per constitution

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architecture designed with 6 planning artifacts covering all aspects from technology choices to developer workflows. Implementation-ready specification with clear contracts and testable requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (planning phase). Test strategy defined: TDD with pytest, 70% MVP coverage, 80% production-ready, test structure mirroring src/ layout.
- 📁 Files: Created 6 planning documents (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, 2 contract files, quickstart.md) + updated CLAUDE.md agent context. Total ~12,000 lines of detailed specification.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks` - generate actionable task breakdown from planning artifacts for TDD implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Layered architecture (Models→Services→CLI) provides clear separation enabling independent testing and future web migration. Contract-first design ensures testability. Stdlib-only approach minimizes dependencies while meeting all requirements. Multi-level sorting and partial updates addressed clarification requirements precisely.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all planning artifacts generated successfully with complete specifications
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Constitution gates passed both initially and post-design. All technical context specified without "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow with Phase 0 research + Phase 1 design + agent context update + post-design constitution check
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider generating minimal example code snippets in contracts for complex patterns (e.g., sorting algorithm, mock input testing) to accelerate implementation understanding
