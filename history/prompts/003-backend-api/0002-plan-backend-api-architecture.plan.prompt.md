## Prompt

Create an implementation plan for the Backend API specification.

Based on `specs/003-backend-api/spec.md`, generate:
- Technical context and constraints
- Constitution compliance check (Simplicity First, Testing, Code Quality, Gradual Implementation)
- Project structure showing new vs. extended files
- Phase 0: Research questions (FastAPI patterns, JWT validation, Pydantic schemas, error handling, testing)
- Phase 1: Design artifacts (API endpoint contracts, auth flow diagrams, quickstart guide)
- Risk analysis and mitigations
- Dependencies (blocked by Stage 1, blocks Stages 3-5)
- Definition of done

The plan should extend the existing `/backend/` structure from Stage 1 without modifying Stage 1's database models or connection logic.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan (`specs/003-backend-api/plan.md`) with:

**Constitution Check - PASS**:
- ✅ Principle I (Simplicity): No unnecessary abstractions, using FastAPI dependency injection, direct CRUD operations
- ✅ Principle II (Testing): 70%+ coverage required, integration tests for all endpoints
- ✅ Principle IV (Code Quality): Type hints enforced by FastAPI, ruff linting required
- ✅ Principle VIII (Gradual Implementation): Stage 2 of 5, builds on Stage 1, enables Stage 3
- ✅ Phase II Tech Stack: FastAPI 0.115.0+, Better Auth JWT, Python 3.13+
- ✅ Monorepo Structure: Extends `/backend/` directory from Stage 1

**Project Structure Defined**:
- **NEW**: `src/api/` (routes, dependencies), `src/schemas/` (Pydantic models), `src/core/` (auth, errors)
- **EXTENDED**: `src/config.py` (JWT settings), `src/database/crud.py` (update/delete operations)
- **REUSED**: `src/models/task.py`, `src/database/connection.py` (unchanged from Stage 1)
- **TESTS**: New `tests/integration/` directory, extended `tests/conftest.py` with API fixtures

**Phase 0 Research Questions** (6 key areas):
1. FastAPI dependency injection for JWT (`get_current_user` pattern)
2. Better Auth integration (token structure, public key validation)
3. Pydantic schema design (separate request/response schemas, `from_attributes=True`)
4. Error handling (FastAPI exception handlers, custom vs. built-in HTTPException)
5. Testing strategy (TestClient from httpx, mock JWT tokens)
6. CRUD extension (update_task/delete_task signatures)

**Phase 1 Design Artifacts**:
- `contracts/api-endpoints.md` - Full OpenAPI specification for 6 endpoints
- `contracts/auth-flow.md` - JWT authentication flow diagram
- API quickstart guide - How to run dev server, test endpoints, view Swagger
- CLAUDE.md update - Document Stage 2 technologies

**Design Decisions Documented**:
- API versioning: Use `/api/` prefix (defer versioning to future)
- Pagination: Defer to enhancement (not required in spec)
- Rate limiting: Defer to production enhancement
- CORS: Allow all origins in dev, specific in production
- Health check: `/health` endpoint (no auth, for monitoring)

**Risk Analysis** (5 risks identified):
1. Better Auth complexity (Medium) → Mitigation: Mock JWT for dev, HS256 algorithm
2. Test coverage <70% (Low) → Mitigation: TDD approach, focus on critical paths
3. JWT validation performance (Low) → Mitigation: Cache public key
4. Database connection issues (Low) → Mitigation: Reuse Stage 1 pooling, health check
5. Pydantic validation errors (Low) → Mitigation: Unit tests for boundary cases

**Dependencies**:
- Blocked by: Stage 1 (Database & Models) - COMPLETE ✅
- Blocks: Stage 3 (Frontend), Stage 4 (User Auth), Stage 5 (AI Features)
- Parallel work: None (on critical path)

**Success Metrics**:
- 6 endpoints implemented + tested
- JWT auth integrated (mock tokens for dev)
- 70%+ coverage maintained
- p95 response time <200ms
- OpenAPI docs accessible
- Ruff checks passing

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architecture plan for Backend API - defines file structure, research questions, design artifacts, and risk mitigations
- 🧪 Tests: Testing strategy defined (integration + unit tests, 70%+ coverage, TDD approach)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/003-backend-api/plan.md (410 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run /sp.tasks to generate actionable task breakdown from this plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan passes all constitution checks, extends Stage 1 without modifications, risks are well-mitigated. Clear separation of NEW vs. EXTENDED files prevents accidental changes to working Stage 1 code.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - planning phase completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution check PASS (all 6 principles satisfied)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow with constitution gate checks
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks for dependency-ordered task generation
