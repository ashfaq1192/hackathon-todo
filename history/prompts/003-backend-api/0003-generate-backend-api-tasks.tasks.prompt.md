## Prompt

Generate actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for the Backend API implementation.

Based on `specs/003-backend-api/spec.md` and `specs/003-backend-api/plan.md`, create:
- Dependency-ordered task breakdown (128 tasks total)
- Tasks organized by phase (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Cross-Cutting → Polish)
- TDD approach: Write tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL, then implement
- Each task includes exact file paths and acceptance criteria
- Parallel opportunities marked with [P] flag
- User story mapping with [US1-US6] labels
- Clear checkpoints after each phase

Task structure:
- Phase 1: Setup (dependencies, directories, config)
- Phase 2: Foundational (BLOCKS all user stories - config, CRUD, schemas, auth, errors)
- Phase 3-8: User Stories (INDEPENDENT after Foundational)
- Phase 9: Cross-Cutting (health check, CORS, OpenAPI docs)
- Phase 10: Polish (testing, linting, validation)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown (`specs/003-backend-api/tasks.md`) with:

**Total Tasks: 128**
- Phase 1 (Setup): 12 tasks - Dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, python-jose, httpx, pytest-asyncio), directories, .env config
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 32 tasks - Config extension, CRUD update/delete, Pydantic schemas, JWT auth, error handlers, test fixtures
- Phase 3 (US1 - List Tasks): 11 tasks - 4 tests + 7 implementation
- Phase 4 (US2 - Create Task): 11 tasks - 4 tests + 7 implementation
- Phase 5 (US3 - Get Single Task): 12 tasks - 4 tests + 8 implementation
- Phase 6 (US4 - Update Task): 19 tasks - 5 tests + 14 implementation (PUT + PATCH)
- Phase 7 (US5 - Delete Task): 10 tasks - 4 tests + 6 implementation
- Phase 8 (US6 - Toggle Complete): 3 tasks - 3 tests (implementation covered by US4 PATCH)
- Phase 9 (Cross-Cutting): 7 tasks - Health check, CORS, OpenAPI customization, README
- Phase 10 (Polish): 11 tasks - Coverage verification, linting, validation, CLAUDE.md update

**Test Coverage: 35 test tasks**
- Unit tests: 11 tasks (schemas, auth, CRUD extension)
- Integration tests: 24 tasks (all 6 endpoints with auth/error scenarios)
- Ensures 70%+ coverage requirement (AC-007)

**Dependency Structure**:
- **Setup → Foundational**: Sequential (Foundational BLOCKS all user stories)
- **Foundational → User Stories**: After Foundational, ALL user stories can run in PARALLEL
- **User Stories (US1-US5)**: INDEPENDENT (different endpoints, no dependencies)
- **User Story 6**: Depends on US4 (reuses PATCH endpoint)
- **Cross-Cutting**: Can run in PARALLEL with user stories
- **Polish**: Depends on ALL user stories completion

**Critical Path**: Setup → Foundational → User Stories (parallel) → Polish

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~40 tasks marked [P]
- Phase 2: Schema creation, schema tests, auth tests can run in parallel
- Phase 3-7: All 5 user stories (US1-US5) can be implemented in parallel
- Phase 9: All 7 cross-cutting tasks can run in parallel

**Implementation Strategy** (Solo Developer):
1. Complete Setup (install deps, create dirs)
2. Complete Foundational (CRITICAL - unlocks all stories)
3. Implement User Stories in groups:
   - Group 1 (READ): US1 + US3
   - Group 2 (CREATE): US2
   - Group 3 (UPDATE): US4
   - Group 4 (DELETE): US5
   - Group 5 (CONVENIENCE): US6
4. Complete Cross-Cutting (health, CORS, docs)
5. VALIDATE: Run full test suite, verify 70%+ coverage
6. Complete Polish (README, linting, final validation)

**TDD Approach Enforced**:
- Each user story: Tests written FIRST (must FAIL before implementation)
- Example: T045-T048 (US1 tests) → T049-T055 (US1 implementation)
- Run tests after implementation: `pytest backend/tests/integration/test_api.py::test_[name] -v`

**Start Commands Documented**:
```bash
# Dev server
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Swagger UI
http://localhost:8000/docs

# Tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for Backend API - 128 actionable tasks with dependencies, parallel opportunities, and TDD approach
- 🧪 Tests: 35 test tasks defined (24 integration + 11 unit), ensures 70%+ coverage requirement
- 📁 Files: Created specs/003-backend-api/tasks.md (505 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run /sp.implement to execute tasks in dependency order, or manually implement following the task sequence
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown enables both solo and team development. User stories are independent after Foundational phase, allowing parallel work. TDD approach ensures quality. Clear checkpoints enable validation at each phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (task planning phase)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with dependency analysis
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation (either /sp.implement or manual task execution)
