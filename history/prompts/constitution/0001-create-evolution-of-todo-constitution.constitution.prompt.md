## Prompt

/sp.constitution # Project Constitution: Evolution of Todo

## Overview
This constitution governs the development of the "Evolution of Todo" project for Hackathon II. It enforces Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus, shifting the role from syntax writer to system architect. The project evolves a Todo app from a simple CLI to a cloud-native AI system, incorporating Reusable Intelligence through skills and subagents.

## Core Principles
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**: All features must start with a Markdown spec. Refine specs iteratively until Claude Code generates correct implementations. No manual coding is allowed—only spec refinement and prompt engineering.
- **Agentic Dev Stack Workflow**: Follow Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. Use Spec-Kit Plus for spec management (e.g., init, generate plan, validate).
- **Reusable Intelligence**: Design modular skills and subagents using the P+Q+P framework (Problem + Query + Plan). For example, create reusable "TaskManagerSkill" for CRUD operations to earn bonus points.
- **Clean Code and Structure**: Adhere to Python best practices (PEP8), modular design, and proper project structure. Use UV for dependency management.
- **No Manual Interventions**: Code must be generated by Claude. Document all Claude sessions, prompts, and iterations in CLAUDE.md for judging.
- **Bonus Alignment**: Incorporate Reusable Intelligence (+200 points), Cloud-Native Blueprints (+200), Multi-language Support (Urdu in chatbot, +100), and Voice Commands (+200) where applicable across phases.
- **Ethical and Compliant Development**: Ensure user data isolation (e.g., via auth in later phases), scalability, and alignment with cloud-native principles.

## Phase-Specific Guidelines
### Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App
- Scope: Implement Basic Level features (Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete) in a CLI app with in-memory storage.
- Data Structure: Use a list of dictionaries (e.g., {'id': int, 'title': str, 'description': str, 'complete': bool}).
- Interface: Menu-driven CLI with user prompts.
- Technology: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus.
- Deliverables: Specs in /specs/ (with history), source in /src/, CLAUDE.md, README.md.

## Future Phases Alignment
- Evolve to full-stack (Phase II), AI chatbot (Phase III), local K8s (Phase IV), and advanced cloud (Phase V).
- Integrate authentication (Better Auth + JWT), databases (Neon PostgreSQL), agents (OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK), and cloud tools (Docker, Minikube, Kafka, Dapr).
- Maintain monorepo structure, expanding to /frontend/ and /backend/ in later phases.

## Enforcement
All specs must reference this constitution. Violations (e.g., manual code) will invalidate submissions. Iterations must be tracked in /specs/history/ for transparency.

## Response snapshot

Constitution created successfully at .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0).

The constitution establishes 7 core principles:
1. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) - All features start with Markdown specs, no manual coding
2. Agentic Dev Stack Workflow - Strict workflow: spec → plan → tasks → implement
3. Reusable Intelligence - Modular skills using P+Q+P framework for bonus points
4. Clean Code and Structure - PEP8, UV dependency management, monorepo pattern
5. No Manual Interventions - 100% Claude Code generation with full documentation
6. Bonus Alignment - Strategic features for +700 bonus points potential
7. Ethical and Compliant Development - Security, privacy, scalability

Phase-specific guidelines included for:
- Phase I: In-memory Python CLI (current focus)
- Phase II: Full-stack web app with PostgreSQL + auth
- Phase III: AI chatbot with Urdu support + voice commands
- Phase IV: Local Kubernetes deployment
- Phase V: Advanced cloud orchestration

All dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks) validated for alignment. Constitution Check gates implemented in planning workflow.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initial constitution ratified, establishing governance for entire hackathon project lifecycle
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with complete constitution v1.0.0
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create first feature spec for Phase I CLI todo app
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear enforcement rules and bonus point strategy. SDD workflow ensures judging criteria met through complete documentation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable (constitution creation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Direct constitution input with comprehensive hackathon requirements
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute /sp.specify for Phase I basic todo features
