## Prompt

Review my constitution and check 1) Are all standards testable and specific? 2) Did I cover all the required detailed and technologies for smooth flow and execution through specification, plan, tasks and implementation? 3)Does anything described repetetive and unncessary? 4) Does we have a clear plan to proceed through phases? As we have to deliver each phase and then we will proceed to the next.

User chose Option A: Prepare minimal updates to start Phase I today.

## Response snapshot

Constitution reviewed across 4 criteria:

**1. Testability & Specificity**: 65% - Found vague terms like "correct implementation", "proper error handling", "reusable" without metrics. Recommended specific acceptance criteria.

**2. Workflow Coverage**: 55% - Critical gaps identified:
- No testing strategy (when to write tests, coverage requirements)
- No branch naming scheme
- No phase transition criteria
- Missing environment setup details
- No approval process defined

**3. Repetition/Bloat**: 70% - Some redundancy found (CLAUDE.md mentioned 3x, "follow all principles" repeated per phase, bonus points listed multiple times)

**4. Phase Progression**: 40% - Unclear Definition of Done, no MVP vs Production distinction, missing rollback plans, no priority system.

**Option A (Minimal Updates) Applied**:
Added "Development Standards" section with 6 critical subsections:
1. Testing Requirements - TDD, 70% coverage for MVP, test structure
2. Version Control & Branching - 001-feature-name format, commit frequency
3. Environment Setup - uv venv, .env structure
4. Approval Process - user confirms at each workflow transition
5. Code Documentation - Google-style docstrings required
6. Logging Standards - Python logging module, format specs

Enhanced Phase I with:
- Definition of Done (MVP): 70% coverage, all 5 features, tests passing
- Definition of Done (Production-Ready): 80% coverage, full validation
- P1/P2/P3 priority breakdown for features
- Branch name: 001-cli-todo-app

Version bumped to 1.1.0 (MINOR) - new sections added without breaking existing principles.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution v1.1.0 ready for Phase I execution - all critical blockers resolved
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md to v1.1.0
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.specify` to create Phase I CLI todo app specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Minimal approach enables fast start while maintaining rigor. Can iterate constitution based on Phase I learnings.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable (constitution amendment)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Comprehensive 4-criteria review with actionable recommendations
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute `/sp.specify` for Phase I first feature: CLI todo app with 5 basic operations
