## Prompt

User requested to commit and push code to GitHub repository (https://github.com/ashfaq1192/hackathon-todo). Initial attempt showed no uncommitted changes in the repository. User then configured the remote repository and requested SSH authentication setup in WSL environment, followed by force push to GitHub main branch.

Full interaction:
1. "/sp.git.commit_pr please commit and push"
2. Added remote: git@github.com:ashfaq1192/hackathon-todo.git
3. Renamed branch from master to main
4. "setup SSH authentication in WSL"
5. Added SSH key to GitHub account
6. "git push -u origin main --force"

## Response snapshot

Successfully configured SSH authentication in WSL and pushed initial code to GitHub:

1. Generated new ED25519 SSH key pair
2. Added GitHub to known_hosts
3. Provided public key for user to add to GitHub account
4. Tested SSH connection (successful authentication)
5. Fetched remote repository to check for conflicts
6. Executed force push to replace remote content with local template
7. Verified repository is in sync

Final state:
- SSH key configured at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
- Remote: git@github.com:ashfaq1192/hackathon-todo.git
- Branch: main (tracked with origin/main)
- Commit: 7e9527e Initial commit from Specify template

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: SSH authentication configured in WSL environment; initial project template successfully pushed to GitHub
- 🧪 Tests: SSH connection test passed (authenticated with ashfaq1192)
- 📁 Files: SSH key files created (~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub, ~/.ssh/known_hosts)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementing hackathon-todo application features
- 🧠 Reflection: Autonomous git workflow agent successfully navigated authentication challenges and repository conflict resolution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial HTTPS authentication failed (no credentials in WSL); SSH host key verification required manual setup; remote repository had different initial commit requiring force push
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): SSH test PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
