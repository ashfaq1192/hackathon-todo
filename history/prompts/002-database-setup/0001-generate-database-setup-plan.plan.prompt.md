## Prompt

User requested to continue from previous conversation context and proceed with `/sp.plan` command for feature 002-database-setup (Database & Models Setup - Phase II Stage 1).

The planning workflow required:
1. Setup: Run setup-plan.sh to get feature paths
2. Load context: Read feature spec and constitution
3. Execute plan workflow:
   - Fill Technical Context
   - Fill Constitution Check section
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Update agent context with new technologies
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed comprehensive planning for Database & Models Setup (Stage 1 of Phase II).

**Phase 0: Research (research.md)**
- Resolved 6 technical decisions: database connection strategy, Task model design with auto-timestamps, database initialization, testing strategy, environment configuration, Neon PostgreSQL best practices
- Selected SQLModel with PostgreSQL engine and connection pooling (5-20 connections)
- Chose auto-create tables with `create_all()` (defer migrations)
- Hybrid testing: SQLite in-memory for units, Neon for integration
- Dependencies: SQLModel 0.0.22+, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, pytest

**Phase 1: Design (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)**
- Defined Task entity with 7 fields (id, user_id, title, description, complete, created_at, updated_at)
- Implemented 5 validation rules with SQLModel/Pydantic
- Created data contract v1.0.0 for Stage 2 API consumption
- Wrote 15-minute developer quickstart guide covering Neon setup, environment config, dependency installation, and testing

**Constitution Check**
- Pre-research: PASS (all 6 principles satisfied)
- Post-design: PASS (re-verified all principles, zero violations)
- Architecture: Monorepo with /backend/ directory, no over-engineering, gradual implementation

**Agent Context**
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Python 3.13+, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, monorepo structure

**Project Structure**
- Backend: 9 files (3 src/, 3 tests/, 3 config)
- Tests: 3 test files covering model validation, connection, CRUD operations
- Documentation: 5 planning artifacts created

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive architectural plan created for database foundation layer, enabling Stage 2 (API) implementation with clear contracts and validation rules
- 🧪 Tests: No tests created (planning phase - test implementation deferred to /sp.tasks)
- 📁 Files: 5 files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/task-schema.md, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable implementation tasks from this plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning workflow executed successfully with thorough research phase resolving all technical unknowns, comprehensive data model design with validation rules, and clear contracts for inter-stage communication. Constitution checks passed both pre-research and post-design with zero violations.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all phases completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (planning phase has no automated graders)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks command to validate plan completeness and generate implementation tasks
