## Prompt

User continued from previous conversation and `/sp.plan` command completed. Now executing `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable implementation tasks.

The task generation workflow required:
1. Setup: Run check-prerequisites.sh to get FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS
2. Load design documents: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
3. Execute task generation workflow:
   - Extract tech stack and structure from plan.md
   - Extract user stories with priorities from spec.md
   - Map entities from data-model.md to user stories
   - Map contracts to user stories
   - Extract setup tasks from research.md decisions
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (P1, P2, P3...)
   - Include tests (explicitly requested in spec: 70%+ coverage requirement)
   - Generate dependency graph showing story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per story
   - Validate task completeness

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown for Database & Models Setup (Stage 1 of Phase II).

**Task Organization**:
- 62 total tasks across 7 phases
- Organized by 4 user stories (all P1 priority due to hierarchical dependencies)
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`

**Phase Breakdown**:
1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks - Create backend/ structure, initialize pyproject.toml, add dependencies (SQLModel, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, pytest), configure .env and ruff
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 2 tasks - Create config.py to load DATABASE_URL, add validation
3. **Phase 3 (US1 - Database Connection)**: 9 tasks - 4 test tasks (conftest.py, connection tests) + 5 implementation tasks (connection.py with pooling, SSL, error handling)
4. **Phase 4 (US2 - Task Model)**: 14 tasks - 6 test tasks (model validation) + 8 implementation tasks (Task SQLModel with all fields, validation rules, timestamps)
5. **Phase 5 (US3 - Database Tables)**: 8 tasks - 3 test tasks (init_db tests) + 5 implementation tasks (init_db.py with create_all())
6. **Phase 6 (US4 - CRUD Operations)**: 10 tasks - 4 test tasks (CRUD tests) + 6 implementation tasks (crud.py with create/read operations)
7. **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 10 tasks - README documentation, test coverage verification (70%+), ruff linting/formatting, acceptance criteria validation

**Test-Driven Development**:
- 17 test tasks total (27% of all tasks)
- Tests written FIRST for each user story (before implementation)
- Tests must FAIL before implementation begins (TDD approach)
- Coverage target: 70%+ (NFR-005 from spec)

**Dependencies**:
- User stories have hierarchical dependencies (US1 → US2 → US3 → US4)
- All stories are P1 priority (foundation layer requires all)
- Sequential execution required due to dependencies

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 20 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
- Tests within each story can run in parallel (different test functions)
- Setup dependencies (T003-T006) can be added in parallel
- Documentation tasks (T053-T055) can run in parallel

**File Structure**:
- backend/src/config.py
- backend/src/database/connection.py, init_db.py, crud.py, __init__.py
- backend/src/models/task.py
- backend/tests/conftest.py
- backend/tests/unit/test_connection.py, test_task_model.py, test_init_db.py, test_crud.py
- backend/.env.example, backend/README.md, backend/pyproject.toml

**Validation**:
- All tasks map to user story acceptance scenarios from spec.md
- Each phase has checkpoint describing validation criteria
- Final phase validates all 10 acceptance criteria from spec.md
- Independent test criteria defined for each user story

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown enabling immediate implementation of database foundation layer with TDD approach, clear dependencies, and validation checkpoints
- 🧪 Tests: 17 test tasks generated (pytest with 70%+ coverage requirement), following TDD workflow (tests first, then implementation)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md with 62 tasks across 7 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks, or manually begin with Phase 1 (Setup) tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully mapped all 4 user stories from spec to concrete implementation tasks with proper TDD workflow. Hierarchical dependencies identified (all stories P1, sequential). Parallel opportunities marked for efficiency. Each task follows strict format with ID, Story label, and file path. Validation checkpoints ensure quality at each phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all user stories mapped to tasks successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (task generation phase has no automated graders)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement command or manual implementation starting with Phase 1 (Setup)
