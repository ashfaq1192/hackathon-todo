Comprehensive guide for deploying password reset functionality in production.

## Environment Variables Setup

2. Add these variables:

```bash
# Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  # or your_domain

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Database

## Resend Email Configuration

### Free Tier (No Domain)

**Using Resend Test Domain:**
```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

**Limitations:**
- Only delivers emails to your Resend account email
- Other users won't receive emails (but flow still works)
- Reset links are logged to console as fallback

**Good for:**
- Development
- Testing
- Hackathons
- Personal projects

### Production (Custom Domain)

**Step 1: Buy a Domain**
- Cost: $10-15/year
- Providers: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare Registrar

**Step 2: Add Domain to Vercel**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add custom domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. Add DNS records provided by Vercel to your domain registrar

**Step 3: Verify Domain in Resend**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `yourdomain.com`
4. Add DNS records provided by Resend to your domain registrar:
   - TXT record for domain verification
   - CNAME records for DKIM
   - MX records (optional)
5. Wait 24-48 hours for verification

**Step 4: Update Environment Variables**
```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
# or
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@yourdomain.com
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Send emails to ANY user
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ No console logging needed

## Alternative: Use Verified Email

You can use your Resend account email as the FROM address:

```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@example.com
```

**Pros:**
- Free
- Works for all users
- No domain needed

**Cons:**
- Emails come from your personal address
- Less professional for production apps

## Resend Free Tier Limits

- **100 emails/day**
- **3,000 emails/month**
- Perfect for:
  - Small apps
  - MVPs
  - Hackathons
  - Testing

## DNS Record Configuration

When verifying a custom domain, you'll need to add these records to your domain registrar:

### 1. Domain Verification (TXT Record)
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or your domain)
Value: [Provided by Resend]
TTL: 3600
```

### 2. DKIM Records (CNAME)
```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Provided by Resend]
TTL: 3600
```

```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend2._domainkey
Value: [Provided by Resend]
TTL: 3600
```

### 3. Return-Path (CNAME)
```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend
Value: [Provided by Resend]
TTL: 3600
```

## Common Deployment Issues

**Issue: "Email sent successfully" but no email received**
- Cause: Resend free tier restriction

**Issue: "Missing API key" error**
- Cause: RESEND_API_KEY not set or not loaded
